Because the idea to allot them in different hostels was to share knowledge of different branch and different courses but I don\u2019t think it is working out, instead there are many drawbacks to it if I personally don\u2019t know many students of my class and during/after class hours we don\u2019t get much time to talk or discuss about some topic and being in different hostel this has created a interaction gap between us",
